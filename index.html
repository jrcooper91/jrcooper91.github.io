    <p>I'm Jenn Cooper, a Madison & Lila Self Graduate Fellow in astrophysics at the University of Kansas. 
      I work on the evolution of galaxies in clusters with the EDisCS collaboration and am supervised by Dr. Gregory Rudnick. Currently, 
      I am investigating the nature vs. nurture scenario for the evolution of galaxies that are in clusters and in the field. 
      Primary observations include WFC3 & grism on <i>Hubble</i> and Magellan at Las Campanas. grism data reduction is completed with 
      <a href="https://github.com/gbrammer/grizli">grizli</a>, developed by Gabriel Brammer. <br /> <br />

      I'm also the Vice President of the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists <a href="https://www.apecs.is">(APECS)</a>
      and on the Board of the US National Committee, <a href="http://usapecs.wixsite.com/usapecs/board">USAPECS</a>,
      both of which aim to continue growing and providing opportunities for polar ECRs around the globe through 
      capacity building, being on the cutting edge of information assessment, and education and outreach. Within astronomy, I am
      on the Steering Committee for Astronomy & Astrophysics from Antarctica <a href="http://www.astronomy.scar.org">SCAR AAA</a>, 
      which brings together astronomical activities in Antarctica in a way that ensures the best possible outcomes from international 
      investment in Antarctic astronomy, and maximizes the opportunities for productive interaction with other disciplines.

      <p> During my master's thesis, I worked on variations in image processing between the commonly used MultiDrizzle and 
        SelfCal, which models and removes zodiacal light in each frame. The area of interest was the Ultra Deep Field in the GOODS-S
        region of CANDELS. SourceExtractor dropout identification of z 4 - 8 galaxies from both maps revealed a significant mismatch of
        sources. I was supervised by Dr. Asantha Cooray and Dr. Hooshang Nayerri for this project.

      <p> I spent 4 months in 2012 at the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory working on the installation of the first infrasound array on the Big
        Island of Hawai'i. Infrasound detects pressure waves in air, much like seismometers detect waves traveling through the ground from 
        sources such as earthquakes. With volcanic activity, infrasound can be crucial to detecting above-ground explosion events, especially 
        in areas that are obscured or difficult to access. Infrasonic activity on the Big Island was correlated with other measurement techniques 
        including seismic, thermal, and optical observations. I was supervised by Weston Thelen, who is now at USGS-CVO.

        In 2015, I traveled to Chile as a part of course directed by Jeffrey Johnson of Boise State University where seismic and infrasound
        stations were installed and updated as a part of monitoring initiative of Villarica. Recent volcanic activity limited fieldwork and the 
        course focused on signal processing. 
        <br /> <br />
        For 2 months in 2013, I worked at the Universidad de Colima monitoring the active Volcan de Colima. Due to the remote nature and 
        difficulty accessing the region, observations were limited to a sparse seismic network, thermal (FTIR), and optical imaging from 
        helicopter overflights. The lab is managed by Nick Varley. 
        <br /> <br />
        For my undergraduate thesis, I studied 100+ volcanoes with satelitte imagery in a method known as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture 
        Radar (InSAR). InSAR works by repeatedly imaging the same region in radio frequencies; when two images are subtracted, any difference 
        in the Earth's surface, such as from excavation or  a landslide is registered as a phase difference. When looking at volcanoes, this 
        phase difference is crucial for deformation, which can indicate movement of magma below the surface or an eruption. For locations such as 
        the Kuriles or the Marianas where physically accessing them is nearly impossible, satellite monitoring allows for a delayed assessment 
        of the volcanic activity. Observations from ALOS (JSA), ERS, RADARSAT were used in this study. I was supervised by Matthew Pritchard.

        <p> I have been a member of the APECS Council since 2015, which serves as a network for early career researchers in the polar
          and wider crysophere communities. While completing my undergraduate thesis on a global study of volcanoes, I often dealt with 
          the effects of high altitude, snow, and ice sheets in my satellite imagery. Somewhere along the way, I stumbled across APECS, 
          which has been a great community to learn and engage with. Even though I am now focused on astronomy, there are still numerous 
          obervatories and projects that use Antartica as a base for operations and I remain involved in the polar community through SCAR 
          AAA. 
        <br /> 
          While on the APECS Council, I have worked on a number of projects and tasks including:<br />
